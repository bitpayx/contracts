# BitpayXToken Smart Contract

This project implements a simple ERC-20-like token contract using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). It includes a local testing environment, deployment scripts, and tooling for Ethereum development.

## Running Locally

You can simulate and deploy this contract in a local Ethereum environment provided by Hardhat.

### 1. Start Local Node

This starts a local Ethereum node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (Hardhat port default).

```bash
npx hardhat node
```
This command:

- Starts a local Ethereum JSON-RPC server.
- Pre-funds a set of testing accounts with ETH.
- Runs in-memory â€” resets on each restart.

### 2. Start Local Node
In a second terminal, run:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```
This command:

- Deploys BitpayXToken to the running local network.
- Mints 1,000,000 BPX tokens to the first account.
- Logs the deployed contract address to the console.
